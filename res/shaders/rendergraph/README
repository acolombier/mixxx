The CMakeLists.txt in this folder generates qsb shader bundles from the spirv shaders.

The qsb files can be used by QML / Qt scene graph QSGShader. Since Qt >= 6.6 we can load the qsb files and extract the glsl shaders
programmatically with QShader and use the with QOpenGLShader. For Qt < 6.6 the files have to generated manually with the script:

generate_shaders_gl.pl

(Make sure qsb and spirv commands are in your path. E.g:
export PATH=$PATH:~/VulkanSDK/1.3.283.0/macOS/bin:~/Qt/6.7.2/macos/bin
)
